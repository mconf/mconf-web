# Space is one of the most important models in the application.
# Spaces consist of a group of multiple users and provide them with a single
# conference room, a posts wall, document repository and space events.
#
# A space can be public or private. Public spaces are open to be read by anyone,
# even users not logged in. Private spaces can only be read by members and membership
# has to be requested or granted via invitation or request.
#
# == Attributes
# * +name+ : String with a human friendly name of the space
# * +permalink+ : The string used to identify the space in URLs
# * +description+ : Text with a human friendly description of the space
# * +public+ : A boolean value denoting whether the space is public
# * +disabled+: A boolean value denoting whether the space has been disabled
# * +logo_image+: A LogoUploader with the data for the image logo
# * +repository+: A boolean value denoting whether document repository is enabled for the space
#
# == Relations
# * +users+: List of users belonging to the space (linked via Permission)
# * +permissions+: Links a user to the space and assigns a roles (see USER_ROLES)
# * +posts+: Posts made on the space wall
# * +attachments+: Attachment(s) uploaded to the space repository
#
# == Activities
# * "space.create": When a space is created (parameters: +user_id+, +username+)
# * "space.update": When a user updates a space (parameters: +user_id+, +username+)
# * "space.leave": When user leaves a space (parameters: +user_id+, +username+)
