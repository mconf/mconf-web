== Architecture

You can add any of the following functionality to any of your ActiveRecord models:

=== Basic
ActiveRecord::Agent:: a model with authentication, authorization and potencial to perform actions over Resources, e.g. a User
ActiveRecord::Resource:: a model that have, at least, {CRUD}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete] operations and can be imported/exported in different formats, like Atom/RSS.
ActiveRecord::Content:: a Resource that belongs to a Container, e.g. a Post
ActiveRecord::Container:: a model that have many Contents, e.g. a Project
ActiveRecord::Stage:: a model that defines an RBAC Authorization framework for Agents, e.g. a Group

=== Complements
ActiveRecord::Taggable:: a model that can be tagged
ActiveRecord::Logoable:: a model with Logo
ActiveRecord::Sortable:: a model with a sortable list

== Generators

=== Agents
An Agent has the capability to post Contents to Containers. An User is the example of Agent

  script/generate station_agent Model

=== Resources

  script/generate station_scaffold Model attributes

== Example

=== Blog

  script/generate station_agent User
  script/generate station_scaffold Article content:text

  rake db:migrate

Users now can entry their own Articles

You can add AtomPub support for Articles creation. You must implement params_from_atom method in Article model:

  def self.params_from_atom(entry)
    { :body => entry.content.xml.to_s }
  end
