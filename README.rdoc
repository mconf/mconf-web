= Mconf-Web

Mconf-Web is the web application that controls the access to the Mconf web conferencing system. It is currently a fork of VCC, an open source system that can be found {here}[https://github.com/ging/vcc].

You can try out Mconf-Web using our free demo server at http://mconf.org.

Mconf-web is a web application that integrates with {BigBlueButton}[http://www.bigbluebutton.org/]-based web conference servers and allows users to create and participate in web conferences. It provides functionalities that are (by design) not implemented in the core of the web conference server, such as:

* User authentication;
* Permission control to access webconference rooms;
* Follows a social network model (inherited from VCC) with spaces (communities) that have events;
* Users have their own webconferences that they can share with other members or even invite non-members.
* Each space also has a webconference room that its members can use to interact;
* Events can be used to schedule webconferences inside a space.
