Mconf-Web is the social network in the Mconf webconferencing system. It is currently a fork of VCC, and open source system that can be found {here}[https://github.com/ging/vcc].

You can try out Mconf-Web at our free demo server at http://mconf.org.

Mconf-web is a web application that connects to a {BigBlueButton}[http://www.bigbluebutton.org/] server instance and allows the users to create and participate in webconferences. It provides functionalities that are (by design) not implemented in the core of BigBlueButton, such as:

* User authentication;
* Permission control to access webconference rooms;
* Follows a social network model (inherited from VCC) with spaces (communities) that have events;
* Users have their own webconferences that they can share with other members or even invite non-members.
* Each space also has a webconference room that its members can use to interact;
* Events can be used to schedule web conferences.
