# Note: DO NOT modify this file, it specifies default values that will be used if you don't
# override them in the actual configuration file.

# Default configurations
# The values defined here will be used as default for all environments (development, test,
# production). You can also define specific configurations for each environment to override
# the defaults. To do that, copy the parameters you want to override and paste them inside
# the environment you want. These environments are commented in the end of this file.

  # You can change the password after the initial setup from within the application.

# "admin_username", you must do something like:
#
# development:
#   site_email: "override the email"
