# Setup configurations
# The values defined here will be used to create the seed data on the database (see db/seeds.rb).
# The section 'default' contain the configurations for all environments (development, test,
# production). If you need you can define specific sections for the environments you want,
# and these configurations will override the ones in the default section.
#
# Almost everyting you setup here can be configured later on from the application's
# web interface!
#
# The parameters that are not commented in the default section are *mandatory*!
# Without any of them your application might not behave appropriately.
